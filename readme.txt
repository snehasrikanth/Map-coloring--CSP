		       ->And then you can run for 2 function DFS with heuristic and DFS without
		       heuristic.
		       -->Choose '1' for american states and '2' for australian states
	->forward_checking_csp.py : 
	               ->Run this code for australia or for american states.

	The same goes for the:->heuristic_included.py
			      ->singleton_csp.py
			      ->singleton_with_heuristic.py
